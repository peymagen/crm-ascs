    question: "What is a Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF)?",
    answer: "A Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF) is a secured loan where you can pledge your mutual fund units as collateral to get instant liquidity without selling your investments. This allows you to continue benefiting from potential market growth while accessing funds for your immediate needs."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Can I choose which mutual fund units to pledge?",
    answer: "Yes, you can choose which mutual fund units to pledge as collateral. However, not all mutual fund schemes are eligible for pledging. Generally, equity and hybrid mutual funds with good track records and high liquidity are accepted. The lender will evaluate the funds based on their performance, AUM, and market volatility."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What is the loan amount range?",
    answer: "The loan amount typically ranges from ₹25,000 to ₹10 crores, depending on the value of your mutual fund portfolio and the lender's policies. The exact amount depends on the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, which usually ranges from 50% to 80% of the current market value of your pledged mutual fund units."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Apply for a LAMF with DhanLAP, you must:",

  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "What is the step-by-step process to get a loan?",
    answer: "The step-by-step process includes: 1) Online application with basic details, 2) Upload required documents (KYC, bank statements, mutual fund portfolio), 3) Portfolio evaluation and loan amount calculation, 4) Loan approval and agreement signing, 5) Mutual fund units pledging process, 6) Loan disbursement to your bank account. The entire process typically takes 24-48 hours for approval and disbursement."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What is the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio?",
    answer: "The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio is the percentage of your mutual fund portfolio's current market value that you can borrow as a loan. For example, if your portfolio is worth ₹1,00,000 and the LTV is 70%, you can get a loan of up to ₹70,000. LTV ratios typically range from 50% to 80% depending on the fund type, performance, and lender policies."
